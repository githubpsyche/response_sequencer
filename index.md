# Abstract

This paper explores the potential of automatic natural language processing (NLP) techniques for preprocessing complex free response data in domains pertinent to psychological research.
We break down the task of coding free response data into discrete preprocessing steps such as text segmentation, response unit matching, and sequence identification and examine a range of applicable technologies for performing them.
Our findings reveal that compared to a baseline approach where sentences in a response are independently compared to target items for matching, a more effective sequence can be established when contextualized embeddings are used for comparing response units to target items.
Furthermore, considering every possible subsequence of the response, rather than segmenting responses by sentence, significantly improves candidate matchings.
We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for automated free response data analysis and propose future research avenues to further refine these techniques.
