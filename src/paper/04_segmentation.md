The first step in preprocessing the data is to segment the data into units of text, such as individual words or phrases. In the free recall task, for example, the data might be segmented into individual words. In the semantic fluency task, the data might be segmented into phrases or sentences. In the autobiographical memory task, the data might be segmented into paragraphs or stories.
