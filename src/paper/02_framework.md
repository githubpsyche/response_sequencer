# Framework

What is the framework I want to develop? How do I elaborate here? I'm still considering a lot of possible approaches, so I guess that part can't be laid out yet.

Some topics I still want to review: - What is the idea unit in narrative free recall? - What about in other datasets such as the feature generation or sense fluency tasks

I guess I need to review techniques and approaches. Unless I really do need to do it in each section?

The goal of this section is to justify the segmentation/correspondence distinction.

I want to present a computational analysis of the data coding task.
