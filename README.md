This project explores the potential of automatic natural language processing (NLP) techniques to preprocess complex free response data in a range of domains.
We examine various frameworks that break down the task of coding free response data into a series of discrete preprocessing steps and evaluate various automated techniques for each step.
Specifically, we compare human and computational methods for segmenting text, matching response units with target items, and identifying the sequence of target items generated in a trial.
We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for automated free response data analysis and identify future directions for research in this area.
